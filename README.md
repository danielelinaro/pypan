# Pypan

This module provides an interface to the circuit and power network simulator PAN. The module is written in pure Python but comes with a precompiled library (in the `src/pypan/data` folder) that serves as the simulation engine.

### Installation

To install pypan on your system, it is sufficient to type the following command at the prompt:

`$ pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pypan`

### Examples

The `examples` folder contains several examples that can be used to familiarize yourself with PAN's syntax.

### Additional documentation

The full PAN documentation is available upon request from PAN's main author [Prof. Angelo Brambilla](mailto:angelo.brambilla@polimi.it?subject=[GitHub]%20Pan%20book).

For any further question, please contact [Daniele Linaro](mailto:daniele.linaro@polimi.it?subject=[GitHub]%20pypan).
